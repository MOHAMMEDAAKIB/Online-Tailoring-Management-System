# Security Summary

This document summarizes the security measures implemented in the Online Tailoring Management System and any remaining considerations.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
✅ **JWT-based authentication**
- Secure token generation with configurable expiration
- Token verification middleware
- Role-based access control (customer/admin)

✅ **Password Security**
- Passwords hashed using bcryptjs with salt rounds
- No plain-text password storage
- Secure password comparison

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
✅ **XSS Protection**
- HTML sanitization in email content using `xss` library
- Prevents malicious script injection in emails

✅ **SQL Injection Prevention**
- Parameterized queries using mysql2 prepared statements
- No string concatenation in SQL queries

### 3. Rate Limiting
✅ **DoS Attack Prevention**
- Authentication endpoints: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Payment endpoints: 10 requests per hour per IP
- General API endpoints: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Implemented using express-rate-limit

### 4. Dependency Security
✅ **Vulnerability Scanning**
- All dependencies updated to secure versions:
  - mysql2: 3.9.8 (fixed RCE and prototype pollution)
  - body-parser: 1.20.3 (fixed DoS vulnerability)
  - multer: 2.0.2 (fixed DoS vulnerabilities)
  - axios: 1.12.0 (fixed SSRF and DoS issues)
- Regular dependency audits recommended

### 5. CORS Configuration
✅ **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**
- CORS enabled for frontend access
- Should be restricted to specific origins in production

### 6. Environment Variables
✅ **Sensitive Data Protection**
- Database credentials in .env
- JWT secret in .env
- API keys (Stripe, email) in .env
- .env files excluded from version control

### 7. Payment Security
✅ **Stripe Integration**
- Server-side payment processing
- No direct card data handling
- PCI DSS compliant through Stripe
- Payment intent verification

### 8. Database Security
✅ **Connection Security**
- Connection pooling
- Prepared statements
- Foreign key constraints
- Cascading deletes for data integrity

## CodeQL Security Scan Results

### Issues Found and Fixed
1. ✅ **Missing Rate Limiting** - FIXED
   - Added rate limiting to all routes
   - Different limits for different endpoint types

2. ✅ **XSS Vulnerability in Email** - FIXED
   - Added HTML sanitization using xss library
   - All user input in emails is now sanitized

### Current Status
**All Critical and High severity issues have been resolved.**

## Recommended Production Security Enhancements

### 1. HTTPS/SSL
⚠️ **Action Required**
- Enable HTTPS for all traffic
- Use Let's Encrypt or commercial SSL certificate
- Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

### 2. Database Security
⚠️ **Action Required**
- Use SSL/TLS for database connections
- Implement database access logging
- Regular automated backups
- Principle of least privilege for database user

### 3. Enhanced Rate Limiting
⚠️ **Consider**
- IP-based blocking for repeated violations
- Progressive rate limiting
- CAPTCHA for suspicious activity

### 4. Session Management
⚠️ **Consider**
- Implement refresh tokens
- Token revocation mechanism
- Session timeout policies

### 5. Logging & Monitoring
⚠️ **Action Required**
- Centralized logging system
- Security event monitoring
- Failed authentication tracking
- Unusual activity alerts

### 6. API Security Headers
⚠️ **Action Required**
Add security headers using helmet.js:
```javascript
const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet());
```

Headers to set:
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security
- Content-Security-Policy

### 7. Input Validation
⚠️ **Consider**
- Add input validation library (joi/yup)
- Validate all request parameters
- Sanitize file uploads
- Limit request body size

### 8. File Upload Security
⚠️ **Action Required** (if implementing photo upload)
- Validate file types
- Scan for malware
- Limit file sizes
- Store in secure location
- Use unique, non-guessable filenames

### 9. API Versioning
⚠️ **Consider**
- Implement API versioning (e.g., /api/v1/)
- Allows gradual security updates
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 10. Two-Factor Authentication
⚠️ **Consider** (especially for admin accounts)
- SMS or authenticator app 2FA
- Backup codes
- Required for sensitive operations

## Security Testing Checklist

- [x] Static code analysis (CodeQL)
- [x] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [x] Authentication testing
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] SQL injection testing
- [ ] XSS testing
- [ ] CSRF testing
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Security header validation

## Incident Response Plan

### If a Security Breach is Detected:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Document the incident
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Review logs
   - Identify attack vector
   - Assess data exposure

3. **Remediation**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Reset compromised credentials
   - Update security measures

4. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Report to authorities if required
   - Public disclosure if necessary

5. **Post-Incident**
   - Update security policies
   - Improve monitoring
   - Staff training

## Security Contacts

For security issues:
- Do NOT open public issues
- Email: [security contact email]
- Report responsibly
- Allow 90 days for patching

## Regular Security Maintenance

### Weekly
- Review error logs
- Check for failed authentication attempts
- Monitor unusual API activity

### Monthly
- Update dependencies
- Review access logs
- Security audit of new features

### Quarterly
- Full security audit
- Penetration testing
- Review and update policies

### Annually
- Third-party security assessment
- Disaster recovery drill
- Security training for team

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- Store only necessary user data
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Secure data transmission
- Data retention policies
- User data deletion on request

### GDPR Compliance (if applicable)
- User consent for data processing
- Right to access data
- Right to be forgotten
- Data portability
- Privacy policy

### PCI DSS (via Stripe)

- Stripe handles PCI compliance
- Regular security assessments

## Security Best Practices for Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use .env files
   - Add .env to .gitignore
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **Validate all input**
   - Never trust user input
   - Sanitize and validate
   - Use whitelists, not blacklists

3. **Use prepared statements**
   - Prevent SQL injection
   - Always parameterize queries

4. **Implement proper error handling**
   - Don't expose stack traces
   - Log errors securely
   - Generic error messages to users

5. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regular npm audit
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Test updates thoroughly

6. **Review code changes**
   - Security-focused code reviews
   - Automated security scanning
   - Follow secure coding standards

## Conclusion

The Online Tailoring Management System has implemented core security measures including:
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting for DoS prevention
- XSS protection
- Secure dependency versions
- SQL injection prevention

For production deployment, additional security measures from the "Recommended Production Security Enhancements" section should be implemented.

Regular security audits and updates are essential to maintain a secure system.
